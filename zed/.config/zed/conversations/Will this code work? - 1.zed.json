{"zed":"conversation","version":"0.1.0","text":"<div\n  className={classNames('rounded-full', {\n    'bg-accent': !favicons[redirect.to],\n  })}\n>\n\nCan you make that bg-accent animated? like a pulsar\nTo create an animated pulsar effect for the background, you can use CSS animations. Here's an example of how you can achieve that:\n\n```jsx\n<div\n  className={classNames('rounded-full', {\n    'bg-accent': !favicons[redirect.to],\n    'pulsar-animation': !favicons[redirect.to],\n  })}\n/>\n\n<style>\n.pulsar-animation {\n  animation: pulsar 2s linear infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar {\n  0% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0.7);\n  }\n  50% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n  100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nIn this example, we add the class `pulsar-animation` when the `bg-accent` class is applied. The `pulsar-animation` class then applies the `pulsar` animation, which creates a pulsating effect using a box shadow. The animation runs infinitely for 2 seconds.\n\nRemember to adjust the colors and animation properties to match your desired pulsar effect.\ncan you make it only with Tailwind classes\n\nTo create the animated pulsar effect using only Tailwind CSS classes, you can utilize the `@keyframes` feature provided by Tailwind CSS. Here's an example:\n\n```jsx\n<div\n  className={classNames('rounded-full', {\n    'bg-accent': !favicons[redirect.to],\n    'animate-pulsar': !favicons[redirect.to],\n  })}\n/>\n\n<style>\n@keyframes pulsar {\n  0% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0.7);\n  }\n  50% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n  100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar-animation {\n  0% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0.7);\n  }\n  50% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n  100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar-infinite {\n  from {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(1.5);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar-reverse {\n  from {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(1.5);\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar-shrink {\n  from {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n  to {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0.7);\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsar-grow {\n  from {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 102, 0, 0.7);\n  }\n  to {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 20px rgba(255, 102, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulsar {\n  animation: pulsar 2s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.animate-pulsar-infinite {\n  animation: pulsar-infinite 0.5s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.animate-pulsar-reverse {\n  animation: pulsar-reverse 0.5s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.animate-pulsar-shrink {\n  animation: pulsar-shrink 0.5s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.animate-pulsar-grow {\n  animation: pulsar-grow 0.5s linear infinite;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `animate-pulsar` class is applied when the `bg-accent` class is active. The `animate-pulsar` class applies the `pulsar` animation, creating the pulsating effect. You can also try different Tailwind CSS animation classes like `animate-pulsar-infinite`, `animate-pulsar-reverse`, `animate-pulsar-shrink`, or `animate-pulsar-grow` to experiment with different pulsar animations.\n\nRemember to adjust the colors and animation properties to match your desired pulsar effect.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":27,"start":96},{"id":28,"start":97},{"id":29,"start":149},{"id":30,"start":1069},{"id":31,"start":1113},{"id":32,"start":3296}],"message_metadata":{"22":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:57:04.683244+02:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:24:40.221502+02:00","status":"Done"},"13":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:37:40.932264+02:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:25:12.239547+02:00","status":"Done"},"10":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:30:30.861315+02:00","status":"Done"},"23":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:57:34.985364+02:00","status":"Done"},"32":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:17:01.040856+02:00","status":"Done"},"7":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:26:04.615195+02:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:24:40.221237+02:00","status":"Done"},"18":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:55:25.395261+02:00","status":"Done"},"21":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:57:04.682596+02:00","status":"Done"},"9":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:30:30.861099+02:00","status":"Done"},"8":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:26:04.615388+02:00","status":"Done"},"17":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:55:25.269727+02:00","status":"Done"},"28":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:16:09.046683+02:00","status":"Done"},"20":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:55:39.674643+02:00","status":"Done"},"16":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:54:35.565253+02:00","status":"Done"},"24":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:57:34.985859+02:00","status":"Done"},"5":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:25:28.065342+02:00","status":"Done"},"15":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:54:35.564751+02:00","status":"Done"},"31":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:17:01.040577+02:00","status":"Done"},"12":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:30:53.505438+02:00","status":"Done"},"19":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:55:39.674407+02:00","status":"Done"},"27":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:16:08.904879+02:00","status":"Done"},"6":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:25:28.065638+02:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:25:12.239708+02:00","status":"Done"},"29":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:16:43.103445+02:00","status":"Done"},"30":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-04T00:16:43.104131+02:00","status":"Done"},"26":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:58:06.295+02:00","status":"Done"},"14":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:37:40.932666+02:00","status":"Done"},"11":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:30:53.505183+02:00","status":"Done"},"25":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-03T23:58:06.294625+02:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-03T21:24:36.840800+02:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Will this code work?","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"}
