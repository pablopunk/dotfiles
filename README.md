# dotfiles

- [x] `nos` will install deps and link files.
- [x] Support brew dependencies.
- [x] `nos -f` will remove the existing configs if they exist (moves config to `*.before-nos`)
- [x] Allows post_install hooks in bash
- [ ] Allows to install only one thing `nos neovim`
- [ ] Allow multiple setups in one repo. Sort of like "hosts" in nix. `nos m1air` reads `profiles/m1air.lua` which includes whatever it wants from `modules/`
- [Â ] Package and distribute `nos` through _brew_
- [Â ] Support more ways of adding dependencies (wget binaries?)
- [ ] Unlinking dotfiles. Something like `nos unlink` should remove all links and copy all files to its destinations (to maintain config).
- [ ] `nos purge`. Same as `unlink` but without copying the files. Just leave the computer "configless".

## ðŸš€ Install

I usually keep the repo in `~/.dotfiles`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablopunk/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```
