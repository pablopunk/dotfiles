Please provide the code you're looking to improve, and I'll do my best to assist you with enhancements, optimizations, or suggestions.\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';\nimport { useUnlinkPrototype } from '../useUnlinkPrototype';\nimport { useUnlinkPrototypeMutation } from '~/generated/gateway-graphql';\n\njest.mock('~/utils', () => ({\n  toast: jest.fn(),\n}));\n\njest.mock('~/generated/gateway-graphql', () => ({\n  useUnlinkPrototypeMutation: jest.fn().mockReturnValue([\n    jest.fn(),\n    {\n      data: {\n        mazePrototypes: {\n          unlinkPrototype: {\n            mazeId: 123,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ]),\n}));\n\njest.mock('~/hooks', () => ({\n  useDispatchApi: () => jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),\n}));\n\ndescribe(useUnlinkPrototype, () => {\n  it('should use the generated graphql hook', async () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useUnlinkPrototype({ mazeId: 123 }));\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.unlinkPrototype();\n    });\n\n    expect(useUnlinkPrototypeMutation).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(result.current.isUnlinking).toBe(false);\n    expect(result.current.displayUnlinkPrompt).toBe(false);\n  });\n});\n\n\nThe provided code demonstrates a test case for a custom React hook `useUnlinkPrototype` using `@testing-library/react-hooks`. The test case validates that the custom hook indeed utilizes a generated GraphQL mutation hook, `useUnlinkPrototypeMutation`, and that certain states within the hook (`isUnlinking` and `displayUnlinkPrompt`) are false after the operation.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to potentially improve your code:\n\n1. Destructure the mutation result to make it clearer:\nInstead of using array destructuring, consider naming the mutation and result for better readability.\n\n2. Add more descriptive test assertions:\nInclude messages in your test assertions to clarify what each assertion is checking. This can make tests easier to understand and diagnose if they fail.\n\n3. Handle asynchronous behavior:\nSince `useUnlinkPrototypeMutation` might contain asynchronous code, ensure you handle it correctly during the test. This sometimes requires awaiting the act callback.\n\nBelow is a revised version of your test code with these suggestions:\n\n```javascript\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';\nimport { useUnlinkPrototype } from '../useUnlinkPrototype';\nimport { useUnlinkPrototypeMutation } from '~/generated/gateway-graphql';\nimport { toast } from '~/utils';\n\njest.mock('~/generated/gateway-graphql', () => ({\n  useUnlinkPrototypeMutation: jest.fn(() => ({\n    unlinkPrototypeMutation: jest.fn(),\n    result: {\n      data: {\n        mazePrototypes: {\n          unlinkPrototype: {\n            mazeId: 123,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  })),\n}));\n\njest.mock('~/hooks', () => ({\n  useDispatchApi: () => jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),\n}));\n\ntoast.info = jest.fn();\n\ndescribe(useUnlinkPrototype, () => {\n  it('should use the generated graphql hook', async () => {\n    const { result, waitForNextUpdate } = renderHook(() =>\n      useUnlinkPrototype({ mazeId: 123 })\n    );\n    \n    await act(async () => {\n      result.current.unlinkPrototype();\n      await waitForNextUpdate();\n    });\n\n    expect(useUnlinkPrototypeMutation).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(result.current.isUnlinking).toBe(false);\n    expect(result.current.displayUnlinkPrompt).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  // It's also a good idea to add tests for various scenarios that useUnlinkPrototype might encounter\n  // e.g., what happens when the mutation succeeds or fails, how does the hook behave, what side-effects are triggered, etc.\n});\n```\n\nPlease note that:\n\n- If the `unlinkPrototype` mutation is synchronous, you wouldn't need to await `waitForNextUpdate()`.\n- If `toast.info` or other `toast` methods are used within the hook, and you want to check if they are called correctly, make sure they are mocked properly and add assertions to verify their invocations.\n- The provided code can be made more reusable or expanded upon by adding more test cases for different scenarios, error handling, and side effects.\n\nRemember, the goal of testing is to ensure your hook behaves as expected, even if its behavior changes later on. It's a good idea to test all logical branches, edge cases, and any asynchronous logic thoroughly.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":1,"start":32},{"id":2,"start":247},{"id":3,"start":1293},{"id":4,"start":4426}],"message_metadata":{"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-01-23T12:07:12.727865+01:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-01-23T12:07:01.210192+01:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-01-23T12:06:43.578004+01:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-01-23T12:07:01.210088+01:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-01-23T12:07:12.726928+01:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Request for code optimization","model":"gpt-4-1106-preview"}
