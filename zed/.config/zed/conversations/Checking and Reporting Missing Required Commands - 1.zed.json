Here's an updated version of the code:\n\n```javascript\nasync function checkRequirements() {\n  const requiredCommands = [\"wget\", \"tar\"];\n  const missingCommands = [];\n\n  // Check if each required command exists\n  await Promise.all(requiredCommands.map(async (command) => {\n    const exists = await commandExists(command);\n    if (!exists) {\n      missingCommands.push(command);\n    }\n  }));\n\n  // If any required command is missing, throw an error\n  if (missingCommands.length > 0) {\n    const missingCommandsString = missingCommands.join(\", \");\n    throw new Error(`Missing required commands: ${missingCommandsString}.`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy breaking down the logic into separate steps and using clear variable names, the code becomes easier to understand and maintain.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":5,"start":419},{"id":6,"start":468},{"id":7,"start":1380}],"message_metadata":{"5":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:34:25.907107+02:00","status":"Done"},"6":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:34:34.117699+02:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:25:01.317335+02:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:25:06.309972+02:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:25:06.310640+02:00","status":"Done"},"7":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:34:34.118742+02:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:24:59.687584+02:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-07-05T17:25:01.172351+02:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Checking and Reporting Missing Required Commands","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"}
